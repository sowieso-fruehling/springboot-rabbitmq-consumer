Example how to consume messsages from rabbitMQ queue

JMS queues and AMQP queues have different semantics. For example, JMS sends queued messages to only one consumer.

Instead, a message is sent to an exchange, which can go to a single queue, or fanout to multiple queues, emulating the concept of JMS topics. For more, see https://spring.io/understanding/AMQP
